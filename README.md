# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program
This program consists of three tasks:
- Data preparation and customer analytics
- Experimentation and uplift testing
- Analytics and commercial application

## Scenario/Background
As apart of Quantium's retail analytics team, the task is to analyse the Chips category and better understand the types of customers who purchase chips and their purchasing behaviour. 
There is a particular focus upon customer segments, and determining how factors such as life stage and customer level contribute to purchasing trends. 
The results of this analysis will be presented in a category review, aiming to provide recommendations based on analytics to a client who is putting together the next years strategic plan. 

## Task 1 Data preparation and customer analytics
- Data was cleaned thoroughly, checking for nulls, outliers, sensible records and converting to appropriate types. Notably, the transaction data was dirty/imperfect, including a bulk order, products other than chips (such as salsa), and missing dates which were all accounted for and cleaned/analysed.
- Metrics and categories such as total sales, number of customers, average units bought, average sales generated, average price per unit, brand preference, pack size preference and type preference were calculated in regards to customer segment. 
- Graphs and Charts to visualise the distribution and trends were created.
- Used hypothesis testing to examine whether the purchasing behaviour of a segment of interest was statistically significant.

Insights include:
- Identifying Mainstream Young Singles/Couples as a valuable target customer segment, due to being 2nd in total sales generated, and 1st in number of customers and average unit price per customer.
- All segments prefer Kettles brand and 175g pack size. Aside from Kettles the target segment (Mainstream Young Singles/Couples) liked Pringles and Doritos, while the other segments liked Smiths.

## Task 2 Experimentation and uplift testing
- Given three trial stores (77, 86, 88), used correlation and magnitude measures to find most similar stores before trial period.
- Compared performance related to total sales and number of customers during the trial period for each trial store and their respective control store.

Insights include:
- Overall the trial appeared to elevate total sales and number of customers. 
- Trial store 88 was a unique store, and appeared to not benefit from the trial compared to the other trial stores. Trial store 88 should be examined further for what happened during the trial. 

## Task 3 Analytics and commercial application
- Used Pyramid Principles to effectively present the results of the analysis and provide actionable recommendations.
